Hello everybody, today we're going to be checking out some of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline hover:text-blue-600" href="https://www.getresponse.com?a=wGtdgRRmAT">best Affiliate Marketing</a> programs for beginners, let's get started! The ones I'll be listing are those that I am either currently using, or have used in the past. As of Sept. 24, 2022 (the creation of this article), I am just starting out with my Affiliate Marketing journey!

  <p class="pl-5">One of my absolute favorite Affiliate Programs is going to be GetResponse! This service makes it so easy to begin your Affiliate Marketing journey, and at such little investment at that! All you need to do is create an account on their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline hover:text-blue-600" href="https://www.getresponse.com?a=wGtdgRRmAT">website</a>, and you can choose between two different plans. The first plan is a monthly recurring program called "Affiliate Recurring Program" and this nets you a 33% recurring commission. GetResponse provides you with several different methods to redirect your audience to your affiliate link, which can potentially result in a conversion! The second plan that they offer is the "Affiliate Bounty Program" which allows affiliates to gain $100 for every successful sale that they make through their affiliate links.</p>
